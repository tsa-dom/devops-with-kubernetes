# Landscape

I found these from the picture

## I've used outside this cource
* MongoDB
* PostgreSQL (also during this course for persisting data in part 1)
* Redis
* Gradle
* GitHub Actions (also during this course for deployment pipelines)
* Nginx
* Heroku

## I've used
* Nats in part 4 to create messaging system for the project
* Helm in part 2 to install prometheus for logging
* Argo in part 4 to add rolling updates
* Flux in part 4 to move project to GitOps
* Kubernetes in the whole course to orchestrate docker containers
* Traefik-proxy in part 1 as a default proxy for the ingress
* Linkerd in part 5 for adding service mesh to the project
* Contour in part 5 to replace traefik-proxy so Knative could work 
* Prometheus in part 2 for logging
* Grafana in part 2 so we're able to use Grafana Loki
* Grafana Loki in part 2 for creating grahps from logs
* K3s in the whole course to create- and destroy kubernetes clusters
* Google Cloud Engine in part 3 to deploy the application to the cloud

Maybe there are some more but pictures were small and there were so many of them.
